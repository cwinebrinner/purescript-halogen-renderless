# Renderless

Renderless components make code reuse possible between Halogen components. This repository contains the minimal implementation for a renderless component you can use as a scaffold to introduce them in your own codebase.

# Use

The component implemented in this project is a working renderless component. Either take it and use it as a scaffold for a new component you're building and would like to share, or use it to update an existing component to be renderless.

For demonstration purposes this is a fully-functioning Halogen app.

- `yarn` will install everything you need
- `yarn build` will build the project, which you can view at `dist/index.html`

# Tutorial

Upcoming. For now the component is exhaustively documented and I recommend reading those comments.

# Todo

- Add an intermediate component example (one that imports the base renderless component, extends it, and repeats the raise/emit pattern).
